# TapTap3

> A Python desktop application for macOS that solves multilingual typing problems with intelligent keyboard layout switching.

## Overview

TapTap eliminates the hassle of manually switching keyboard layouts when typing in multiple languages. Simply continue typing and double-tap the Caps Lock key to retroactively correct text typed in the wrong language.

### How It Works

```
User types: "In russian, word hello is "ghbd"
User double-taps Caps Lock
Result: "In russian, word hello is "–ü—Ä–∏–≤"
```

When you double-tap Caps Lock, taptap:
1. Deletes all characters typed since the last space
2. Switches to the next available keyboard language
3. Re-types the characters using the correct language mapping

## Features

- üéØ **Word-Boundary Detection**: Only corrects the current word (since last space)
- ‚ö° **Fast Response**: 500ms detection window for double-tap
- üñ•Ô∏è **Global Hotkeys**: Works across all macOS applications
